# Loan-Busters: Predicting Loan Defaulters
#Overview
Loan-Busters is a data-driven project aimed at predicting loan defaulters using advanced data mining techniques. This project leverages a rich dataset from the Lending Club and implements Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models to evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment failures.

#Features
Data Analysis: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) including correlation, handling imbalanced data, and categorical feature analysis.
Model Implementation: Detailed implementation of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.
Performance Evaluation: In-depth model comparison and performance evaluation using ROC curves, precision, and recall metrics.
Data Source: Utilizes data from LendingClub.com (2007-2010) with 9,578 records.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
