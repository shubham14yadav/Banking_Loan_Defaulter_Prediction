# Loan-Busters: Predicting Loan Defaulters
# Overview
Loan-Busters is a data-driven project aimed at predicting loan defaulters using advanced data mining techniques. This project leverages a rich dataset from the Lending Club and implements Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models to evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment failures.

# Features<br>
Data Analysis: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) including correlation, handling imbalanced data, and categorical feature analysis.<br>
Model Implementation: Detailed implementation of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.<br>
Performance Evaluation: In-depth model comparison and performance evaluation using ROC curves, precision, and recall metrics.<br>
Data Source: Utilizes data from LendingClub.com (2007-2010) with 9,578 records.<br>

# Key Findings<br>
High-Risk Indicators Identified: Analysis revealed specific borrower attributes, such as credit score and debt-to-income ratio, as significant indicators of loan default risk.<br>

Model Performance: The Decision Tree model demonstrated high precision in identifying defaulters, while the Logistic Regression model excelled in overall accuracy.<br>

Imbalanced Data Handling: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were effectively employed to address data imbalance, improving model reliability.<br>

Predictive Insights: The project provided valuable insights for financial institutions in refining their loan approval processes, potentially reducing default rates.<br>
